# use the dsci-lab

## Update course material

Open a terminal (e.g. with `Ctrl-Alt-t`). Navigate into our course directory:

```sh
cd dsci
```

Note:
* Of course you can type in above command. 
* You also can copy this command from firefox (use `Strg-C`) and paste it into the terminal, here with `Strg-Shift-V`
* Try also to hit the `Cursor-UP` key to select the command from the command-history.

Get the latest version of our course material:

```sh
git pull
```

We have prepared this directory in advance with information from where to pull additional data.
