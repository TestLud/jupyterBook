dsci-lab
========

Abbreviations:

-   dsci-vlab: data science virtual lab
-   VM: virtual machine

VirtualBox 6.x
--------------

In order to run the VM and play with the data science tools you need \*
to install the free software VirtualBox, Version 6.x \* to download the
VM, which is essentially a rather large file (about 10GB) \* to plug the
virtual hard disk into VirtualBox: ready for take off!

How to build the from scratch
-----------------------------

You don't have to build the VM from scratch by yourself. However, if you
wish to do so, this would be the steps:

-   Download ISO image of Xubuntu e.g. from XXX, save it to e.g. XXX
-   Allocate a new virtual machine (say `my-machine`) in VirtualBox and
    point to the ISO image
-   start `my-machne`; install a fresh Xubuntu; update the freshly
    installed machine to a current version

``` {.python}
!ls -ls
```

Now you have a clean, brand new virtual XUbuntu machine. To get our
dsci-lab version you have to install some more packages.
